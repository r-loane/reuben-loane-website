    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Reuben Loane and I am a Professional Animator from Northern
      Ireland. I primarily work in the medium of Stop-Motion, but I have
      experience in 2D animation using After Effects and Cel Action. </p>


      <p>
          I am also confident in using Photoshop, Premiere and Final Cut Pro for
          image and video editing. Most recently I have worked as an Animator on
          CBBC's Scream Street. Before this I was an animator on Disney's Club
          Penguin: We Wish You a Merry Walrus. I have also worked on Wanda and The
          Alien using Cel Action and worked as a Freelance Animator for
          Crosslinks.

          Currently, I am available for freelance work to make films,
          music videos, advertisements or hold animation workshops for any age
          group. For any more information on me or my work please contact me. I
          would love to hear from you.
